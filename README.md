# first-vue-github
```
Using vue 3 cli to build a vue application (attempting a single page application using vue router).
Current plan
1. website
    a. single page app
    b. host on netlify
2. add Axios usage with reqres.in 
    a. Axios, JS promise (Async Await), RESTful
    b. requests and responses.
    c. firebase or sql database?
    d. display based on requests/responses
3. css
    a. research + trial & error
    b. research and learn css preprocessors for the future projects
4. Additionals
    a. attempt to do node as well and add some cool stuff
    b. would be good to have a smooth and nice idea of how to do everything that exists in this world right now
    c. prepare for things like vite, nuxt and astro, these are some cool technologies that use vue as a basis (or at least they can)
    d. make sure to understand using vue 3 well before moving on, there are quite a few things that make vue more complicated than vanilla js, but these things also help to make the framework easier to use in the long run to make complex applications that are easier for the developer to trouble shoot and also make better in the future for the long run and for what is to come.
