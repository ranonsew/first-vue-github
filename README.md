# first-vue-github
```
Using vue 3 cli to build a vue application (attempting a single page application using vue router).
Current plan
1. develop a basic looking website to mimic that of the goldensheep project
    1. quick relook into bootstrap 4 for css (or perhaps simply pure css for certain aspects)
    1. single page app development of the website to improve loading times of the various pages
    1. host the repository on netlify to do full testing
1. add Fetch API usage with reqres.in (fake data testing)
    1. improve knowledge on Fetch API, JS promise (Async Await at some point), and RESTful APIs
    1. understand how to do various requests and receive responses.
    1. perhaps try to develop a sql database and host it on the web?
        1. would require a lot more knowledge into RESTful APIs and online database hosting.
        1. might not even work but it might so that's my input for researching what I need to do.
    1. variably display certain aspects differently based on responses and requests
1. css, learn more to make site look nice
    1. would require more experience of looking at various sites and taking notes, which sites look better and why
    1. research needs to be done and while doing various normal tasks (video watching, reading, etc), make sure to continue to ponder why a site looks nice and how it could be implemented with html & js & css
    1. important to have better knowledge of css and js by the end of the project, or at the very least (since project might be an infinite work in progress type project) have better knowledge of js and css partway through the project
